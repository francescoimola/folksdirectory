        <h2>Why we built a directory</h2>
        <p>Creatives in Folkestone are working in isolation, unaware of potential collaborations around the corner.</p>
        <p>
          We've heard one too many "wait, you do <em>what</em>? I've been looking for someone who does that forever!"
        </p>
        <p>People have been doing and making and showing up all along, but good luck trying to find them. They were
          scattered across social media, informal group chats, and segregated directories. Meanwhile, businesses were
          hiring from London and beyond because they didn't know there's a great illustrator two doors down.</p>
        <p>Until now.</p>
