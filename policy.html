            Folks Directory (sometimes stylised as <em>folks.directory</em> and referred to here as the "directory") is Folkestone's community-run yellow pages for creative talent. We are a free, public resource connecting artists, designers, makers and creative practitioners—with each other and with local businesses—in the Folkestone area.

          <h2>What information we collect</h2>
          <p>
            When you join the directory, we collect:
          </p>
          <ul class="marked-list">
            <li>Your email address</li>
            <li>A link to your website, portfolio or public social media profile</li>
            <li>Information about your skills and services</li>
            <li>Any details you choose to share about where people are likely to find you</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            We don't collect personal information like home addresses or phone numbers.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>How we use your information</h2>
		  <p>We process your information based on your consent, which you give by voluntarily submitting your details to join the directory, therefore aknowledging we're an informal collective without regulatory oversight (see the <i>Public Listing Considerations</i> section below).</p>
          <p>
            <strong>Your email address</strong> is kept private and used only by directory organizers and volunteers to contact you about:
          </p>
          <ol class="marked-list">
            <li>Updates to your directory listing</li>
            <li>Directory developments and improvements</li>
            <li>Local events we organise (or recommend)</li>
		  </ol>
          <p>
            We send these communications either directly from our folksdirectory@gmail.com address, Airtable (airtable.com) for automated updates, or via Loops (loops.so) for our newsletters. We maintain strict controls over who has access to these accounts.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Your professional information</strong> (skills, submitted website, expertise, where to find you in person) is displayed publicly in the directory to help people find and connect with you. We store data securely in Airtable (airtable.com). Please note this is an US-based platform, which means your data may be transferred outside the UK and EU. We've chosen this platform for its security features, reliability, and ease of maintenance.
          </p>

        <section>

          </ul>

        <section>
          <h2>Data security and access</h2>
          <p>
            We use standard security practices and only authorized volunteers involved in maintaining the directory have access to the full database. We never sell or share your email address with third parties.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>How long we keep your data</strong>: We keep your information for as long as you want to be listed in the directory. If you haven't confirmed you want to stay listed after 2 years, we'll email to check you still want to be included.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>If something goes wrong</strong>: We don't have formal breach reporting obligations but we take security seriously. If we ever become aware of a data breach that could affect you, we commit to notifying you via email as soon as possible.
          </p>

        <section>
          <h2>Who can join</h2>
          <p>
            The directory is for adults (18+) only. By submitting your information, you confirm you're 18 or older.
          </p>

          <h2>Public listing considerations</h2>
          <ol class="marked-list">
            <li>Your professional information will be publicly visible online.</li>
            <li>While we don't publish personal details like home addresses or phone numbers, your listing will help people identify and contact you through your website or professional channels.</li>
            <li>As with any public directory, there's a possibility that someone could misuse this information, though we've seen no evidence of this in similar grassroots initiatives.</li>
            <li>You're making an informed choice to participate in this public resource.</li>
		  </ol>
        </section>

		<section>
        <h2>We're a volunteer collective.</h2>
		<p>We operate as individual volunteers rather than a formal entity, and therefore cannot register with the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO). This means:</p>
          <ul class="marked-list">
            <li>While we follow data protection principles as best we can, we don't have the same formal obligations as registered organizations.</li>
            <li>You still have the right to complain to the <a href="https://ico.org.uk/make-a-complaint/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ICO</a>, but they may have limited ability to take action against an informal collective. We recommended to first address your complaint directly with us before escalating it to any other party.</li>
            <li>We are working to become a Community Interest Company in the near future. In the meantime, we rely on trust and our commitment to the community.</li>
			<li>The Folks Directory volunteers act as joint data controllers for your information to the best of our ability within these constraints.</li>
            <li>By joining the directory, you accept the above limitations.</li>
          </ul>
