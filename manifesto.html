          <h2>What is folks.directory?</h2>
          <p>
            A free public directory of creatives who live or work in Folkestone.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Why are we doing this?</h2>
          <p>
            Creative working can be isolating. We believe people can find what they need, whether that's work, tools, or community—through finding each other.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>What are we trying to achieve?</h2>
          <p>
            Create a centralised information point for Folkestone creatives so that they can be more visible and well-connected to the Folkestone community.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>How are we doing this?</h2>
          <p>
            We are a local directory where individuals can sign up to be publicly listed. This information is publicly available to everyone (other creatives, organisations, and individuals). Creatives can sign up anytime through our website. We approve and add new applicants to the directory, organise events, and share opportunities via our mailing list. The directory is run by a small team of volunteers.
          </p>

        <section>
          <h2>What do members get from joining?</h2>
          <ul class="marked-list">
            <li>Access to a trusted creative community.</li>
            <li>Increased visibility to the community at large (including businesses, orgs, venues, and other creatives)</li>
            <li>Invites to free networking and skill-swapping events.</li>
            <li>Access to a seasonal mailing list that highlights other creatives and opportunities.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>How are we supporting the community of creatives in Folkestone?</h2>
          <p>
            Folkestone is full of creative people making wonderful things happen, but there is a lack of visibility. As a town, we have no central information-sharing point (or directory), which means much of their work (and the skillset they have to offer) is lost before it can reach the people who would love it. Folks.directory exists to bridge this gap. The more people who participate in the directory, the stronger our community can become.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>We are open to collaboration.</h2>
          <p>Partners can support us by:</p>
          <ul class="marked-list">
            <li>Spreading the word about the directory and signing up.</li>
            <li>Sharing their events for us to advertise in our mailing list.</li>
            <li>Volunteering co-hosting events and creative walks with us.</li>
            <li>Providing free event space or for folks.directory office space.</li>
