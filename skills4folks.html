           Trade what you're good at for the help you need. Join Folkestone's budding and
            professional creatives for a stroll through town as we talk skills
            bartering and connect over drinks.
          </p>

          <h2>Why barter</h2>
          <p>
            When we (we) think of bartering, we think of yes, a mutually beneficial exchange, but also a middle finger thrust at an economy that doesn't value our skills, resources and time enough. Bartering is an age-old yet sorely needed support system, especially for people early in their career or creative practice.
          </p>
          <p>
            Say you ink great tattoos and want to open your own shop, but you've no clue on how to take
            great photos of your work. You could be waiting in line at Lidl next to the photographer who's keen to get a killer tattoo. That's where bartering comes in.
          </p>
          <p>It's for this reason that we're centring the walks around it. After all, collaboration and helping to build a stronger creative community is what <a href="/">the directory</a> is all about. </p>

          <h2>What to expect</h2>
          <p>
            A slow walk, chatting as we go. We reach The Beer Shop, where
            conversations can really get going over a drink. If you've clicked
            with someone, offer to swap space, skills, artworks or tools. Trade
            illustration work for drum lessons, swap website tweaks for homemade
            sourdough or secure studio space in exchange for teaching someone a
            new language. What you're willing to barter is up to you.
          </p>
          <p>
            Expect a crowd of artists, designers, writers, content creators,
            craftspeople, curators, gardeners, and side-hustlers.
          </p>
