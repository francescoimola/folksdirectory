           Trade what you're good at for the help you need. Join Folkestone's budding and
            professional creatives for a stroll through town as we talk skills
            bartering and connect over drinks.
          </p>

          <h2>What to expect</h2>
          <p>
            A slow walk, chatting as we go. We reach <s>The Beer Shop</s> Pomus, where
            conversations can get going over a drink. If you've clicked
            with someone, consider how it would feel to swap space, skills, artworks or tools.</p>
          <p>Trade illustrations for drum lessons, website tweaks for homemade
            sourdough or studio space in exchange for teaching someone a
            new language. What (AND IF) you're willing to barter is up to you.
          </p>
          <p>
            The walk is casual and open to all self-styled creatives. You're welcome to bring a friend
            along, especially if you're new to Folkestone. If you have any
            questions, please email us at
            <a href="mailto:folksdirectory@gmail.com">folksdirectory@gmail.com</a>

          <h2>Why barter</h2>
          <p>
            When we (we) think of bartering, we think of 1) a mutually beneficial exchange and 2) a middle finger thrust at an economy that doesn't value our skills, resources and time enough. Bartering is an age-old yet sorely needed support system, especially for people early in their career or creative practice.
          </p>
          <p>
            Say you ink great tattoos and want to open your own shop, but you've no clue on how to take
            great photos of your work. You could be waiting in line at Lidl next to the photographer who's keen to get a killer tattoo. That's where bartering comes in.
          </p>
          <p>It's for this reason that we're centring the walks around it. After all, collaboration and helping to build a stronger creative community is what <a href="/">the directory</a> is all about. </p>

          <p>
            Sangmin, Stephen and Francesco are the collective behind Folks
