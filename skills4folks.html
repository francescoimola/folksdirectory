          <h2>In short</h2>
          <p>Three walk and talk meetups happening in Folkestone every last Thursday of the month across Summer 2025.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Trade what you're good at for the help you need—join Folkestone's
            budding and professional creatives for a slow stroll through town,
            followed by skill bartering and connecting over drinks at a local
            pub.
          </p>

          <h2>What's it all about</h2>
          <p>
            You know how it is: perhaps you ink beautiful tattoos but you've no
            clue on how to take great photos of your work. Equally, maybe you're
            a photographer who's keen to get a killer tattoo.
          </p>
          <p>That's where bartering skills comes in:</p>
          <p>
            Creatives helping each other out when money's tight or when you need
            a hand with something outside your wheelhouse. Enter Skills 4 Folks.
          </p>

          <h2>What to expect</h2>
          <p>
            We kick things off with a walk through town (nothing strenuous,
            promise!) and chat as we go. We then head to The Beer Shop, where
            conversations can really get going over a pint. Clicked with
            someone? Swap illustration work for drum lessons, trade website
            tweaks for homemade sourdough or secure studio space in exchange for
            helping to mix an album. What you're willing to barter is up to you.
          </p>
          <p>
            Expect a mixed crowd of artists, designers, writers, content
            creators, craftspeople, curators, gardeners, side-hustlers and more.
          </p>
