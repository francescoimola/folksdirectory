          Trade what you're good at for the help you need—join Folkestone's
          budding and professional creatives for a slow stroll through town,
          followed by skill bartering and connecting over drinks at a local pub.
        </p>
        <h2>What's it all about</h2>
        <p>
          You know how it is: perhaps you ink beatiful tattoos but you've no
          clue on how to take great photos of your work. Equally, maybe you're a
          photographer who's keen to get a killer tattoo.
        </p>
        <p>That's where bartering skills comes in:</p>
        <p>
          Creatives helping each other out when money's tight or when you need a
          hand with something outside your wheelhouse. Enter Skills 4 Folks.
        </p>
        <h2>What to expect</h2>
        <p>
          We kick things off with a walk through town (nothing strenuous,
          promise!) and chat as we go. We then head to The Beer Shop, where
          conversations can really get going over a pint. Clicked with someone?
          Swap illustration work for drum lessons, trade website tweaks for
          homemade sourdough or secure studio space in exchange for helping to
          mix an album. It's that simple.
        </p>
        <p>
          Expect a mixed crowd of artists, designers, writers, content creators,
          craftspeople, curators, gardeners, side-hustlers with a creative
          hobby, and more.
        </p>
